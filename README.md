This is a visually appealing Temperature Converter website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units.

## Features

- Conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:
  - The website provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a temperature value and select the unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) they want to convert from.
  - Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the website performs the temperature conversion using the provided formulae and displays the converted values in the other two units.

## Technologies Used

The Temperature Converter website is developed using the following technologies:

- HTML: The structure and markup of the website are created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
- CSS: The website is styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to enhance its visual appearance and layout.
- JavaScript: The temperature conversion logic and interactivity of the website are implemented using JavaScript.
